    <h2 id="L1">Leader 1 : Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj </h2>
    <p>Shivaji , also referred to as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha
        clan.[5] Eventually, Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of
        Bijapur which formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his
        realm at Raigad Fort.

        Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the
        Sultanate of Golkonda, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaiji's military forces
        expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji
        established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived
        ancient Hindu political traditions, and court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit
        languages, replacing Persian in court and administration.

        Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he began to take on
        increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists
        elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.</p>


    <h2 id="L2">Leader 2 : Swami Vivekananda </h2>
    <p>Swami Vivekananda, was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of
        the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world
        and he is credited with raising interfaith awareness and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world
        religion. Vivekananda became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, where he began
        his famous speech with the words, "Sisters and brothers of America...," before introducing Hinduism to
        Americans. He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by
        divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament". After great success at the Parliament, in
        the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States, England and Europe,
        disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta
        Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern California), both of which became the foundations for
        Vedanta Societies in the West.</p>

    <h2 id="L3">Leader 3 : Bal Gangadhar Tilak </h2>

    <p>Bal Gangadhar Tilak, endeared as Lokmanya, was an Indian nationalist, teacher, and an independence activist. He
        was one-third of the Lal Bal Pal triumvirate. Tilak was the first leader of the Indian independence movement.
        The British colonial authorities called him "The father of the Indian unrest". He was also conferred with the
        title of "Lokmanya", which means "accepted by the people as their leader". Mahatma Gandhi called him "The Maker
        of Modern India". Tilak was one of the first and strongest advocates of Swaraj ('self-rule') and a strong
        radical in Indian consciousness. He is known for his quote in Marathi: "Swaraj is my birthright and I shall have
        it!". He formed a close alliance with many Indian National Congress leaders including Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala
        Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo Ghose, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.</p>
